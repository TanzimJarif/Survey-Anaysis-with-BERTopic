# Survey Anaysis with BERTopic
This project performs topic modeling and text analysis on "The Kindness Test" dataset. It utilizes various techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), BERTopic, and statistical methods, to extract meaningful topics and insights.

## Features
Preprocessing: Tokenization, POS tagging, and feature extraction using libraries such as NLTK and Gensim.
Topic Modeling:
LDA with Scikit-learn for traditional topic extraction.
BERTopic for advanced topic modeling using contextual embeddings.
Evaluation: Coherence scores to assess topic quality.
Visualization: Results are visualized with UMAP and other plotting techniques.

## Libraries Used
Basic Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tqdm
Natural Language Processing: nltk, gensim
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
Topic Modeling: BERTopic, umap, hdbscan, sentence-transformers
Others: scipy, collections
